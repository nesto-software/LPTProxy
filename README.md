Development Status
------
We are currently doing some research on how to integrate older printers into the ProxySuite.
There is not much documentation on the internet about that.
We are working on a proxy solution in software (i.e. forwarding data using the pi's CPU) which integrates <a href="https://www.retroprinter.com/">Retro-Printer</a> modules.
